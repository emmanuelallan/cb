            Help Ambros Breathe Easy Again â€“ A Special LoFi-Afrobeat EP for a
            Cause
          </h1>
          <p className="w-full overflow-hidden para-control">
            Hey everyone, my name is Emmanuel Allan, also know us my dear
            shelter and Iâ€™m a music producer with a passion for creating soulful
            Afrobeat tunes. Today, Iâ€™m reaching out not just as a musician, but
            as a friend in need of your support.
          </p>

          <p className="w-full overflow-hidden para-control">
            My dear friend Ambros, just 22 and still in university, recently
            started experiencing shortness of breath. What was supposed to be a
            routine checkup turned into a heart-wrenching discovery. The doctors
            found fluid in his lungs, suspecting it could be tuberculosis (TB)
            or, even more frightening, a cancerous growth. ðŸ˜”
          </p>

          <div
            className={`overflow-hidden transition-all duration-500 ease-in-out ${
              isExpanded
                ? "max-h-[1000px] opacity-100 space-y-4"
                : "max-h-0 opacity-0"
            }`}
          >
            <p className="w-full overflow-hidden para-control">
              This is serious. Ambros needs an in-depth examination at Aga Khan
              Hospital, but the test costs $1500, and thatâ€™s just the beginning.
              Weâ€™re still unsure of the treatment costs that might follow.
            </p>

            <p className="w-full overflow-hidden para-control">
              Like many, I donâ€™t have $1500 readily available. But I believe in
              the power of community, music, and standing together in tough
              times. So, Iâ€™ve decided to do what I do best â€“ create something
              meaningful. Iâ€™m crafting a 10-song LoFi-Afrobeat EP to raise the
              funds Ambros needs.
            </p>

            <p className="w-full overflow-hidden para-control">
              Now, the EP is still under construction, but Iâ€™ve got two preview
              tracks ready for you to listen to on the music player below. ðŸŽ§
              These tracks will give you a taste of whatâ€™s coming, and I canâ€™t
              wait for you to hear the full project.
